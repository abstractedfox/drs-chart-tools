comparing both music-info-base.xml and music-info-offline.xml

im fairly certain most of the data in the info tag is not actually used in game anywhere lol

<mdb output_level="#">
    -output_level is 0 in music-info-offline and 1 in music-info-base
    <music id="#"> (many; one for each song.)
        -id == the ID of the song

                -that
            <artist_yominaga>
                -seems to also be skinny katakana for japanese

                        -tl;dr: for some unlock missions, this will be a value that is contingent on competing the mission (ie a score to reach)
                        -if we look at "Go Down" as an example, mission text says to score more than 2100 points, and this value is set to 2100 there, so it seems to be the value that the condition relies on in some cases
                        -however, a subsequent discount says to clear a song with 92 points or more, and in that one, this value is just 1, with 92 showing up in a precondition tag under <preconditions>. we should probably do a separate document for analyzing how unlock missions work

                                -this contains other values that the unlock mission is contingent on. for example, in go down's "score 92 points or more on (music 345)", one is 345 and one is 92 (and another one is 2, whatever that means)

further info:
    -for a song to be visible when offline, it has to have its <info><limitation_type>set to 2 to be visible and locked, or 3 to be unlocked unlocked, and per-chart it requires that chart's <playable> tag to be set to 1 (if you set an easy chart to 0 and hard chart to 1, the song will not even display on easy)
    -db is only read at game boot as far as i can tell, modifications will not show until the game is restarted

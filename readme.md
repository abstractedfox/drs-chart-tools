## drs-chart-tools: Library for modifying chart and music database data

Currently has everything you need to generate and manipulate charts programmatically, and some of what you need to do that to the database.

#### Current feature status:
- Charts
    - Has everything necessary to generate and modify steps, including via the api
    - Has limited implementation of manipulation of effects and backgrounds (supported in xml abstraction but incomplete implementation in layers above)
- Database
    - XML abstraction only

/notes is just my own unorganized notes from looking into the format, they're not guaranteed to be 'nice' but they may be sufficient in case anyone else needs an idea of how the format works
